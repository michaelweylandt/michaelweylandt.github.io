**Abstract:** Network data are commonly collected in a variety of applications,
representing either directly measured or statistically inferred connections
between features of interest. In an increasing number of domains, these
networks are collected over time, such as interactions between users of a
social media platform on different days, or across multiple subjects, such as
in multi-subject studies of brain connectivity. When analyzing multiple large
networks, dimensionality reduction techniques are often used to embed networks
in a more tractable low-dimensional space. To this end, we develop a framework
for principal components analysis (PCA) on collections of networks via a
specialized tensor decomposition we term Semi-Symmetric Tensor PCA or SS-TPCA.
We derive computationally efficient algorithms for computing our proposed
SS-TPCA decomposition and establish statistical efficiency of our approach
under a standard low-rank signal plus noise model. Remarkably, we show that
SS-TPCA achieves the same estimation accuracy as classical matrix PCA, with
error proportional to the square root of the number of vertices in the network
and not the number of edges as might be expected. Our framework inherits many
of the strengths of classical PCA and is suitable for a wide range of
unsupervised learning tasks, including identifying principal networks,
isolating meaningful changepoints or outlying observations, and for
characterizing the "variability network" of the most varying edges. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal on simulated data and on an
example from empirical legal studies. The techniques used to establish our main
consistency results are surprisingly straightforward and may find use in a
variety of other network analysis problems.

**Summary:** We develop and approach for performing Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on *network series* data - sets of networks observed on the same node set. Network series data are observed when a changing network is observed over time (*e.g.*, a social media network at the end of each week) or when a statistical network is estimated from time series data (*e.g.*, stock market correlation networks in different years). We approach this problem by embedding the network series in a **semi-symmetric** tensor and performing tensor PCA on this representation.

We rigorously analyze Tensor PCA in the semi-symmetric context, proving consistency under an analogue of the "low-rank + noise" model for matrix PCA: somewhat remarkably, despite the difficulty of the tensor setting, our results are within a logarithmic factor of classical PCA results. Our proof technique depends on the classical Davis-Kahan theorem (and some painful algebra) and we hope to apply it further to a variety of tensor decomposition problems. Finally, we apply our method to a variety of synthetic and real data sets and find some counter-intuitive results about the Supreme Court of the United States.

An interesting quick of our analysis is that it allows for differing and possibly adversarial noise at each iteration of the
tensor power method. While we don't explore this fully, this has clear implications for both secure and online variants
of our approach.

**Presentations:** I presented this work at the 2022 Conference on New Advances in Statistics and Data Science (NASDS) and won the 2022 NASDS Best Poster Award.
