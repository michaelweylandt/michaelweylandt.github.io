Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Michael Weylandt. Beginning October 2022, I will be a postdoctoral appointee in the Statistical Sciences group at Sandia National Laboratories, working J. Derek Tucker and Laura P. Swiler. Until then, I am an US Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellow hosted at the University of Florida Informatics Institute, where I am advised by George Michailidis as well as two mentors from the Intelligence Community. Before this, I earned my Ph.D. at Rice University in 2020, worked in finance from 2013 to 2015, and taught at Sherborne School in the UK from 2012 to 2013. My research is in statistical machine learning, with a recent focus on network data and in machine learning fairness. For a more formal bio, please see my [CV](assets/Weylandt_CV.pdf) and my [About](about.html) page. More detail on my  [Publications](publications.html) and [Software](software.html) can be found on those pages.
