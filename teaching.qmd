[^fn0]: Currently, my plan is for the Tuesday and Thursday sections
of the full semester offering to be interchangeable. Students who
register for one section will be able to attend the other section
occasionally if they have a conflict that week. The half-semester
section will be run separately.

[^fn1]: I will not be teaching STA9715 in Fall 2025. 
[Prof. Rongning Wu](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/profiles/faculty/Rongning-Wu) 
will be teaching this course instead.
