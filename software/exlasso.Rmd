The **ExclusiveLasso** **R** package implements the Exclusive Lasso penalty as analyzed by Campbell and Allen (*EJS*, 2017), for Gaussian, logistic, and Poisson regression. The interface is **glmnet** compatible and the package supports both proximal gradient and coordinate descent solvers. 

The package vignette is also notable for a thorough derivation of the back-tracking proximal Newton algorithm used for penalized GLMs, giving more detial than I have found elsewhere. Reading it would be useful for 1st or 2nd year Ph.D. students interested in efficient implementation of this family of algorithms.
