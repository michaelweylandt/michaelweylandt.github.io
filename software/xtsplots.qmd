The **xtsPlots** **R** package implements an alternative framework for plotting time series in **R**. The package was originally developed in 2012 and pre-dates the rise of modern plotting toolkits in **R**. While the package is still usable, it is no longer actively developed and the ideas in it have been superseded by a newer plotting engine in the **xts** package.
