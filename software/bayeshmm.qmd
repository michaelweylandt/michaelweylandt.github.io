The **BayesHMM** **R** package implements a comprehensive framework for Bayesian inference of Hidden Markov Models, including a tailored DSL for model specification, automatic translation to the **Stan** modeling language, and a variety of diagnostic tools. Under the hood, the package uses the techniques we discuss in [our tutorial](../publications/luis.html), but additional performance improvements could be achieved by rewriting the backend to use Stan's new built-in HMM tools. The package should be stable, but has not been thoroughly validated.
