The **clustRviz** **R** package implements the **CARP** and **CBASS** algorithms for computing the entire convex clustering solution path. In addition to the path-wise solvers, the package also implements efficient algorithms for solving the convex clustering and bi-clustering problems at a fixed grid of penalty parameters. The package also implements a novel method for simultaneous clustering and imputation, making it one of the few pieces of clustering software that can trnasparently handle missing values.
