      "contents": "\nMichael Weylandt is currently an Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Fellow, working with George Michailidis at the University of Florida. His work focuses on statistical machine learning theory for structured multivariate time series, viewed through a graphical model lens. His work has been recognized with best paper awards from the American Statistical Association in both Statistical Learning and Data Science and in Business & Economic Statistics. He has served as a mentor in the Google Summer of Code program for 7 years on behalf of the R Foundation for Statistical Computing and previously held an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Prior to beginning his Ph.D. studies, he worked at Morgan Stanley as a quantitative analyst, focusing on derivatives pricing and financial risk management. He received a Bachelor’s of Science in Engineering from Princeton University in 2008 and a Ph.D. in Statistics from Rice University in 2020.\nFor more details, see my Full CV.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nHello and welcome to my website! My name is Michael Weylandt. I am currently an US Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellow hosted at the University of Florida Informatics Institute, where I am advised by George Michailidis as well as two mentors from the Intelligence Community. Before this, I earned my Ph.D. at Rice University in 2020, worked in finance from 2013 to 2015, and taught at Sherborne School in the UK from 2012 to 2013. My research is in statistical machine learning, with a recent focus on network data and in machine learning fairness. For a more formal bio, please see my CV and my About page. More detail on my Publications and Software can be found on those pages.\n\n\n\n",
