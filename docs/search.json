Despite these advantages, convex clustering has not been widely adopted, due to its computationally intensive nature and its lack of compelling visualizations. To address these impediments, we introduce Algorithmic Regularization, an innovative technique for obtaining high-quality estimates of regularization paths using an iterative one-step approximation scheme. We justify our approach with a novel theoretical result, guaranteeing global convergence of the approximate path to the exact solution under easily-checked non-data-dependent assumptions. The application of algorithmic regularization to convex clustering yields the Convex Clustering via Algorithmic Regularization Paths (CARP) algorithm for computing the clustering solution path. On example data sets from genomics and text analysis, CARP delivers over a 100-fold speed-up over existing methods, while attaining a finer approximation grid than standard methods. Furthermore, CARP enables improved visualization of clustering solutions: the fine solution grid returned by CARP can be used to construct a convex clustering-based dendrogram, as well as forming the basis of a dynamic path-wise visualization based on modern web technologies. Our methods are implemented in the open-source R package clustRviz, available at https://github.com/DataSlingers/clustRviz.\nPublisher DOI: 10.1080/10618600.2019.1629943\nPubMed: 32982130\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 1901.01477\nSummary: In this paper, we look at efficient algorithms for the convex clustering problem:\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{U}}_{\\lambda} = \\text{arg min}_{\\mathbf{U} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}} \\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{U}\\|_F^2 + \\lambda \\left(\\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n}  w_{ij} \\|\\mathbf{U}_{i\\cdot} - \\mathbf{U}_{j\\cdot}\\|_q\\right)\\]\nChi and Lange (JCGS, 2015) showed that the ADMM can solve this problem efficiently for fixed \\(\\lambda\\), but how should we think about this problem for multiple values of \\(\\lambda\\)? This is a more acute problem than in, e.g., sparse regression, because we need a large set of \\(\\lambda\\) values to construct a dendrogram representation of our data and the correct values of \\(\\lambda\\) are not known a priori. To make convex clustering practical, we need an algorithm to solve for a very fine grid of \\(\\lambda\\) values quickly: thankfully, we do not actually need highly accurate solutions as we are more interested in which points get clustered than in the (biased) cluster centroid estimates.\nConvex Clustering Solution PathsTo solve this problem, we propose a new form of extreme warm-start early-stopping that we call algorithmic regularization. By only increasing \\(\\lambda\\) by a small amount (to obtain a fine grid), warm-start techniques are sufficient to ensure that a single ADMM step gets a “good enough” solution. We term this approach CARP - Clustering via Algorithmic Regularization Paths\nInput:\nData matrix: \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}\\)\nWeighted edge set: \\(\\mathcal{E} = \\{(e_l, w_l)\\}\\)\nRelaxation parameter: \\(\\rho \\in \\mathbb{R}_{> 0}\\)\n\nPrecompute:\nDifference matrix \\(D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{E}| \\times n}\\)\nCholesky factor \\(L = \\textsf{chol}(I + \\rho D^TD) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}\\)\n\nInitialize:\n\\(U^{(0)} = X\\), \\(V^{(0)} = DX\\), \\(Z^{(0)} = V^{(0)}\\), \\(\\gamma^{(1)} = \\epsilon\\), \\(k = 1\\)\n\nRepeat until \\(\\|V^{(k - 1)}\\| = 0\\):\n\\(U^{(k)} = L^{-T}L^{-1}\\left[X + \\rho D^T(V^{(k - 1)} - Z^{(k - 1)})\\right]\\)\nIf \\(q = 1\\), for all \\((i, j)\\): \\[V_{ij}^{(k)} = \\textsf{SoftThreshold}_{w_i \\gamma^{(k)}/ \\rho}((DU^{(k)} + Z^{(k - 1)})_{ij})\\]\nIf \\(q = 2\\), for all \\(l\\): \\[V^{(k)}_{l\\cdot} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\gamma^{(k)} w_l}{\\rho\\|(DU^{(k)} + Z^{(k - 1)})_{l\\cdot}\\|_2}\\right)_+(DU^{(k)} + Z^{(k - 1)})_{l\\cdot}\\]\n\\(Z^{(k)} = Z^{(k - 1)} + DU^{(k)} - V^{(k)}\\)\n\\(\\gamma^{(k + 1)} = t \\gamma^{(k)}\\)\n\\(k := k + 1\\)\n\nReturn \\(\\{(U^{(l)}, V^{(l)}\\}_{l = 0}^{k - 1}\\)\nWe rigorously justify our approach by showing convergence of the CARP path and the true solution set in the Hausdorff metric:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nd_H(\\{\\mathbf{U}^{(k)}\\}, \\{\\hat{\\mathbf{U}}_{\\lambda}\\}) \\equiv \\max\\left\\{\\sup_{\\lambda} \\inf_k \\left\\|\\mathbf{U}^{(k)} - \\hat{\\mathbf{U}}_{\\lambda}\\right\\|, \\sup_{k} \\inf_\\lambda \\left\\|\\mathbf{U}^{(k)} - \\hat{\\mathbf{U}}_{\\lambda}\\right\\|\\right\\}  \\xrightarrow{(t, \\epsilon) \\to (1, 0)} 0\\\\\nd_H(\\{\\mathbf{Z}^{(k)}\\}, \\{\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}_{\\lambda}\\}) \\equiv \\max\\left\\{\\sup_{\\lambda} \\inf_k \\left\\|\\mathbf{Z}^{(k)} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}_{\\lambda}\\right\\|, \\sup_{k} \\inf_\\lambda \\left\\|\\mathbf{Z}^{(k)} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}_{\\lambda}\\right\\|\\right\\} \\xrightarrow{(t, \\epsilon) \\to (1, 0)} 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis can be summarized as CARP finding “the whole path and nothing but the path.”\nHausdorff Convergence of CARP AlgorithmExperimentally, we find that only moderately small step sizes are necessary to accurately estimate the dendrogram structure of the data. We extend this approach to Convex Bi-Clustering as well, giving the CBASS algorithm, which is a tortured acronym for Convex Bi-Clustering via Algorithmic Regularization with Small Steps. The version of CBASS in the paper does not guarantee Hausdorff convergence, but the modified version currently in the clustRviz R package does.\nOur theoretical analysis uses simple ingredients to show Hausdorff convergence:\nGeometric convergence of the ADMM (here implied by strong convexity, but this can often be relaxed)\nLipschitz continuity of the solution path\nA compact set of non-trivial \\(\\lambda\\) values\nCombining these in a “daisy-chaining” analysis (and several pages of inequalities) gives Hausdorff convergence. We believe this is a viable strategy for a wide range of statistical learning problems for which the “shape” of the solutions is more interesting than obtaining a single high-precision estimate.\nWe implement these algorithms in our clustRviz R package which is the fastest “whole path” solver available for the convex clustering. Later work has proposed better base algorithms than the ADMM and it would be interesting to use the Algorithmic Regularization strategy to boost these into “whole path” solvers.\nTiming ComparisonsPresentations: I was invited to give a talk on my convex clustering work at the Lund University Statistical Learning Seminar, which can be viewed below:\n\n\nDirect YouTube Link. Slides from a more focused talk on the CARP and CBASS algorithms can be found here.\nRelated Software: The clustering methodology from this paper is implemented in my R package clustRviz. The algorithmic regularization scheme from this paper was applied to the Generalized ADMM from my paper on co-clustering algorithms to give the improved CBASS algorithm in the package.\nCitation:\n@ARTICLE{Weylandt:2020,\n  AUTHOR=\"Michael Weylandt and John Nagorski and Genevera I.

Recent convex formulations of bi-clustering and tensor co-clustering, which shrink estimated centroids together using a convex fusion penalty, allow for global optimality guarantees and precise theoretical analysis, but their computational properties have been less well studied. In this note, we present three efficient operator-splitting methods for the convex co-clustering problem: a standard two-block ADMM, a Generalized ADMM which avoids an expensive tensor Sylvester equation in the primal update, and a three-block ADMM based on the operator splitting scheme of Davis and Yin. Theoretical complexity analysis suggests, and experimental evidence confirms, that the Generalized ADMM is far more efficient for large problems.\nPublisher DOI: 10.1109/DSW.2019.8755599\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 1901.06075\nSummary: Chi and Lange (J.

      "contents": "\nAbstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analyzing signals arising in a variety of domains. In many applications of GSP, multiple network structures are available, each of which captures different aspects of the same underlying phenomenon. To integrate these different data sources, graph alignment techniques attempt to find the best correspondence between vertices of two graphs. We consider a generalization of this problem, where there is no natural one-to-one mapping between vertices, but where there is correspondence between the community structures of each graph. Because we seek to learn structure at this higher community level, we refer to this problem as “coarse” graph alignment. To this end, we propose a novel regularized partial least squares method which both incorporates the observed graph structures and imposes sparsity in order to reflect the underlying block community structure. We provide efficient algorithms for our method and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations.\nPublisher DOI: 10.1109/SSP49050.2021.9513753\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 2104.02810\nSummary: We consider the problem of aligning two graphs on different node sets, e.g., Facebook and Twitter. Many users may be represented on both networks, but there are also a large number of users who use only one social media platform. Solving this problem exactly entails a (generalization) of the NP-hard graph-alignment problem, so we consider a relaxation in which we seek to find corresponding communities (e.g., basset hound enthusiasts) across both networks. To do so, we assume that common signals are observed on both networks (e.g., interest in a particular celebrity dog) and use that signal to align communities. Because this approach aligns communities rather than nodes and does so using (potentially noisy) signals, we refer to the resulting problem as the CONGA problem (Coarse Noisy Graph Alignment).\nCONGA Generative Model: Common Signals Excite Corresponding CommunitiesWe proceed by constructing the signal correlation matrix across the two graphs and performing a regularized SVD on this inner product:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\text{arg max}_{\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}} & \\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{U}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}_1^\\top\\mathbf{X}_2\\mathbf{V}) - \\lambda_1P_1(\\mathbf{U}) - \\lambda_2P_2(\\mathbf{V})  \\\\\n    \\text{subject to }&{\\mathbf{U} \\in \\textsf{conv}\\,\\mathcal{V}^{\\mathbf{I}_{n_1} + \\alpha_1\\mathbf{L}_1}_{n_1 \\times K}, \\mathbf{V} \\in \\textsf{conv}\\,\\mathcal{V}^{\\mathbf{I}_{n_2} + \\alpha_2\\mathbf{L}_2}_{n_2 \\times K}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis approach builds on my work on multi-rank sparse and functional PCA and extends it to the partial least squares context. The use of the flexible SFPCA regularization framework allows us to simultaneously achieve four goals:\nEach community is supported on a sparse set of graph 1 nodes (\\(P_1(\\mathbf{U})\\))\nEach community is supported on a sparse set of graph 2 nodes (\\(P_2(\\mathbf{V})\\))\nEach community is well clustered with respect to graph 1, i.e., each community is smooth with respect to the Laplacian \\(\\mathbf{L}_1\\)\nEach community is well clustered with respect to graph 2, i.e., each community is smooth with respect to the Laplacian \\(\\mathbf{L}_2\\)\nThe resulting estimator is computationally efficient and performs well in simulation, as shown in our paper. We hope to further study this model theoretically, but correlated sampling of graphs on different node sets is a tricky and open problem.

In many applications where we observe noisy signals, it is common practice to first denoise the data, perhaps using wavelet denoising, and then to apply a clustering algorithm. In this paper, we develop a sparse convex wavelet clustering approach that simultaneously denoises and discovers groups. Our approach utilizes convex fusion penalties to achieve agglomeration and group-sparse penalties to denoise through sparsity in the wavelet domain. In contrast to common practice which denoises then clusters, our method is a unified, convex approach that performs both simultaneously. Our method yields denoised (wavelet-sparse) cluster centroids that both improve interpretability and data compression. We demonstrate our method on synthetic examples and in an application to NMR spectroscopy.\nPublisher DOI: 10.1109/DSLW51110.2021.9523413\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 2012.04762\nSummary: We consider the problem of clustering highly noisy signals. The dual nature of this problem gives rise to a puzzle: if we denoise the individual signals and then cluster, the resulting cluster centroids will be noisy, but if we cluster and then denoise, our clustering accuracy will be sub-par. We instead propose to simultaneous denoise and to cluster by combining wavelet soft-thresholding with convex clustering. The resulting approach identifies clusters which are denoised (wavelet sparse), while retaining the excellent statistical performance of convex clustering:\n\nOur approach be expressed as the following convex optimization problem:\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{U} - \\mathbf{X}\\|_F^2 + \\lambda  \\sum_{\\substack{i, j = 1 \\\\ i < j}}^n w_{ij} \\|\\mathbf{U}_{i\\cdot} - \\mathbf{U}_{j\\cdot}\\|_2 + \\gamma \\sum_{j = 1}^T \\omega_i \\|\\mathbf{U}_{\\cdot j}\\mathbf{\\Psi}\\|_2\\]\nIf \\(\\Psi\\) represents a full-rank wavelet basis, this reduces to the sparse convex clustering problem on the wavelet coefficients, for which we provide a new and efficient algorithm. We apply this approach to a cell-subtyping problem in which (noisy) NMR spectra are sampled from individual brain cells. Our approach is able to identify the different cell lines most accurately and to identify key NMR peaks identifying each cell type.\nConvex Wavelet Clustering of NMR SpectraCitation:\n@INPROCEEDINGS{Weylandt:2021-ConvexWaveletClustering,\n  AUTHOR=\"Michael Weylandt and T.

While most attention in the nascent field of algorithmic fairness has focused on bias mitigation for supervised learning, biases can also be a problem for unsupervised analyses. With Principal Components Analysis (PCA), for example, biased dimension reduction can affect downstream analysis as well as affect data exploration and modeling decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Fair PCA that finds debiasing projections of the data, or projections that remove the effect from any protected attribute. We show that our approach has many advantages over existing formulations of Fair PCA including a fast, closed form solution, generality and wide applicability to many protect attributes, and its ease of interpretation and usage like projections in classical PCA. We demonstrate the bias mitigating advantages of our Fair PCA method compared to existing proposals for Fair PCA on several synthetic and benchmark datasets.\n\n\n\n",

Yet, improved fairness often comes at the expense of model accuracy. While aspects of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff have been studied, most work reports the fairness and accuracy of various models separately; this makes model comparisons nearly impossible without a unified model-agnostic metric that reflects the Pareto optimal balance of the two desiderata. In this paper, we seek to identify, quantify, and optimize the empirical Pareto frontier of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff, defined as the highest attained accuracy at every level of fairness for a collection of fitted models. Specifically, we identify and outline the empirical Pareto frontier through our Tradeoff-between-Fairness-and-Accuracy (TAF) Curves; we then develop a single metric to quantify this Pareto frontier through the weighted area under the TAF Curve which we term the Fairness-Area-Under-the-Curve (FAUC). Our TAF Curves provide the first empirical, model-agnostic characterization of the Pareto frontier, while our FAUC provides the first unified metric to impartially compare model families in terms of both fairness and accuracy. Both TAF Curves and FAUC are general and can be employed with all group fairness definitions and accuracy measures. Next, we ask: Is it possible to expand the empirical Pareto frontier and thus improve the FAUC for a given collection of fitted models? We answer in the affirmative by developing a novel fair model stacking framework, FairStacks. FairStacks solves a convex program to maximize the accuracy of a linear combination of fitted models subject to a constraint on score-based model bias. We show that optimizing with FairStacks always expands the empirical Pareto frontier and improves the FAUC; we additionally study other theoretical properties of our proposed approach. Finally, we empirically validate TAF, FAUC, and FairStacks through studies on several real benchmark data sets, showing that FairStacks leads to major improvements in FAUC that outperform existing algorithmic fairness approaches.\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 2206.00074\n†These authors contributed equally.\nSummary: Given recent interest in questions of ML/Algorithmic fairness, we pause\nto ask how best to compare fair ML models. Specifically, while it is easy to compare\nmodels on fairness or accuracy, it is less obvious how to compare them on both axes.\nThe difficulty of this question is compounded by the fact that many of these models\nhave a “trade-off” parameter that allows the analyst to balance fairness and (overall)\naccuracy in a problem-specific way. We take inspiration from the economic / multi-objective optimization\nliterature and consider the Pareto frontier attainable by a model (possibly as the tradeoff\nparameter is varied). We give an efficient algorithm for finding this Pareto frontier\n(TAF) and show that an AUC-type measure (FAUC) can be used to compare fair ML models\nunder any utility function. A significant advantage of our framework is that it\nis model- and definition-agnostic, so it is possible to give an unbiased comparison\nof models which are trained under different loss functions or constraints. Having\ndeveloped the TAF/FAUC framework, we next apply it to a fair model stacking\nframework (FairStacks) and show that ensembling can always improve the\nfairness/accuracy tradeoff of any set of models. The stacking context is particularly\nuseful for fair ML as it allows the analyst to use powerful and potentially pre-trained\nbase learners while still achieving fairness goals.\nComparison of Fair ML Techniques Using TAF/FAUC FrameworkWhile the main contributions of the paper are the preference-theoretic analysis of the\nmodel evaluation question and the FairStacks meta-learner, I think this paper has several other\nuseful theoretical contributions which are worth future study:\nWe give sufficient conditions under which convex (score-based) fairness constraints\ntranslate to decision fairness, which is typically what is actually used in practice.\nWe connect fairness and model combinations with randomization and convex combinations\nof statistical testing procedures. These latter literatures are rich and give a\nstraight-forward (and in many circumstances nearly optimal) way of “fair-ing”\nan existing base learner.\nWe give finite-sample distribution free guarantees on the out-of-sample accuracy\nand fairness of our method. These results are pretty standard applications of VC/PAC\ntheory, but we expect they may be useful in audit studies of fairness as well.\nSummary of TAF/FAUC Framework and FairStacks Meta-LearnerFinally, while our focus was on model evaluation and comparison, we also note that\nour framework can be used for data comparison, e.g., to compare the fairness of data\ncollected before and after some real-world policy intervention.\nCitation:\n@ARTICLE{Little:2022,\n  AUTHOR=\"Camille Olivia Little and Michael Weylandt and Genevera I.

Plasma samples were collected prospectively from 767 patients with HCC and 200 controls, and 317 proteins were quantified in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified biomarker testing laboratory. We constructed a circulating biomarker aberration score for each patient, a score between 0 and 1 that measures the degree of aberration of his or her biomarker panel relative to normal, which we call HepatoScore. We used log-rank tests to assess its ability to substratify patients within existing staging systems/prognostic factors. To enhance clinical application, we constructed a single-sample score, HepatoScore-14, which requires only a subset of 14 representative proteins encompassing the global biological effects. Patients with HCC were split into three distinct groups (low, medium, and high HepatoScore) with vastly different prognoses (medial overall survival 38.2/18.3/7.1 months; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, HepatoScore accurately substratified patients within levels of existing prognostic factors and staging systems (P < 0.0001 for nearly all), providing substantial and sometimes dramatic refinement of expected patient outcomes with strong therapeutic implications. These results were recapitulated by HepatoScore-14, rigorously validated in repeated training/test splits, concordant across Myriad RBM (Austin, TX) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, and established as an independent prognostic factor.\nConclusions: HepatoScore-14 augments existing HCC staging systems, dramatically refining patient prognostic assessments and therapeutic decision making and enrollment in clinical trials. The underlying strategy provides a global biological characterization of disease, and can be applied broadly to other disease settings and biological media.\nPublisher DOI: 10.1002/hep.31555\nPubMed: 32931023\nCitation:\n@ARTICLE{Morris:2021,\n  AUTHOR=\"J.S.

We show that alternative deflation schemes can more efficiently extract signal from the data, in turn improving estimation of subsequent components. Finally, we compare the performance of our manifold optimization and deflation techniques in a scenario where orthogonality does not hold and find that they still lead to significantly improved performance.\nPublisher DOI: 10.1109/CAMSAP45676.2019.9022486\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 1907.12012\nSummary: This work extends my previous work on Sparse and Functional PCA to the case of estimating multiple principal components. While classical PCA gives nicely orthogonal and simultaneously estimable1 components, the situation for sparse PCA is less compelling.

(These methods require one or more matrix decompositions at each iteration, so they don’t scale to very large data.) While directly solving the rank-\\(k\\) problem is best, I also propose some improvements to the greedy rank-1 strategy that guarantee weaker forms of orthogonality.

Like other commodities markets, there is an inherent spatial structure to natural gas markets, with different price dynamics for different points of delivery hubs. Certain hubs support highly liquid markets, allowing efficient and robust price discovery, while others are highly illiquid, limiting the effectiveness of standard risk management techniques. We propose a joint modeling strategy, which uses high-frequency information from thickly-traded hubs to improve volatility estimation and risk management at thinly-traded hubs. The resulting model has superior in- and out-of-sample predictive performance, particularly for several commonly used risk management metrics, demonstrating that joint modeling is indeed possible and useful. To improve estimation, a Bayesian estimation strategy is employed and data-driven weakly informative priors are suggested. Our model is robust to sparse data and can be effectively used in any market with similar irregular patterns of data availability.\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 1907.10152\nSummary: In this work, we built a new model for risk management (volatility forecasting) of US Natural Gas markets. These markets are interesting in that they combine a overall “market” effect with location-specific volatility. We adapt the “Realized Beta GARCH” model of Hansen, Lunde, and Voev (J. Applied Econometrics, 2014) to this problem, combining high-frequency data from NYSE futures markets with daily data from geographically diverse spot markets. We give a Bayesian analysis of this problem, developing realistic priors, thoroughtly evaluating MCMC sampler performance, and rigorously validating the out-of-sample forecast accuracy of our approach. The specific findings of our analysis are less of interest - and likely to be out of date anyways - but the analytical framework and evaluation methodology are rigorous and can be easily applied to other risk management problems.\nWAIC Evaluation with Outlier DetectionOut-of-Sample Volatility Forecast Validation\n\n\n",

Due to the enormous scale of climate data, dimension reduction methods are used to identify major patterns of variability within climate dynamics, to create compelling and informative visualizations, and to quantify major named modes such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Principal components analysis (PCA), also known as the method of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), is the most commonly used form of dimension reduction, characterized by a remarkable confluence of attractive mathematical, statistical, and computational properties. Despite its ubiquity, PCA suffers from several difficulties relevant to climate science: high computational burden with large datasets, decreased statistical accuracy in high dimensions, and difficulties comparing across multiple datasets. In this paper, we introduce several variants of PCA that are likely to be of use in climate sciences and address these problems. Specifically, we introduce non-negative, sparse, and tensor PCA and demonstrate how each approach provides superior pattern recognition in climate data. We also discuss approaches to comparing PCA-family results within and across datasets in a domain-relevant manner. We demonstrate these approaches through an analysis of several runs of the E3SM climate model from 1991 to 1995, focusing on the simulated response to the Mt.

Many examples of massive data, have both sparse and functional (smooth) aspects and may benefit from a regularization scheme that can capture both forms of structure. For example, in neuro-imaging data, the brain’s response to a stimulus may be restricted to a discrete region of activation (spatial sparsity), while exhibiting a smooth response within that region. We propose a unified approach to regularized PCA which can induce both sparsity and smoothness in both the row and column principal components. Our framework generalizes much of the previous literature, with sparse, functional, two-way sparse, and two-way functional PCA all being special cases of our approach. Our method permits flexible combinations of sparsity and smoothness that lead to improvements in feature selection and signal recovery, as well as more interpretable PCA factors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on simulated data and a neuroimaging example on EEG data.\nPublisher DOI: 10.1109/DSW.2019.8755778\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 1309.2895\nSummary: We give a unified proposal for regularized PCA, allowing for both sparsity and smoothness (functional structure) in both the estimated observation and feature embeddings (left and right singular values):\n\\[\\text{arg max}_{\\mathbf{u} \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{B}}^n_{\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{u}}}, \\mathbf{v} \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{B}}^p_{\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{v}}}} \\mathbf{u}^T\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{v} - \\lambda_{\\mathbf{u}} P_{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{u}) - \\lambda_{\\mathbf{v}} P_{\\mathbf{v}}(\\mathbf{v})\\]\nOur approach incorporates a variety of prior proposals as special cases, including:\nClassical (Unregularized) PCA\nOne-Way Sparse PCA: Shen and Huang (J.

In an increasing number of domains, these\nnetworks are collected over time, such as interactions between users of a\nsocial media platform on different days, or across multiple subjects, such as\nin multi-subject studies of brain connectivity. When analyzing multiple large\nnetworks, dimensionality reduction techniques are often used to embed networks\nin a more tractable low-dimensional space. To this end, we develop a framework\nfor principal components analysis (PCA) on collections of networks via a\nspecialized tensor decomposition we term Semi-Symmetric Tensor PCA or SS-TPCA.\nWe derive computationally efficient algorithms for computing our proposed\nSS-TPCA decomposition and establish statistical efficiency of our approach\nunder a standard low-rank signal plus noise model. Remarkably, we show that\nSS-TPCA achieves the same estimation accuracy as classical matrix PCA, with\nerror proportional to the square root of the number of vertices in the network\nand not the number of edges as might be expected. Our framework inherits many\nof the strengths of classical PCA and is suitable for a wide range of\nunsupervised learning tasks, including identifying principal networks,\nisolating meaningful changepoints or outlying observations, and for\ncharacterizing the “variability network” of the most varying edges. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal on simulated data and on an\nexample from empirical legal studies. The techniques used to establish our main\nconsistency results are surprisingly straightforward and may find use in a\nvariety of other network analysis problems.\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 2202.04719\nSummary: We develop and approach for performing Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on network series data - sets of networks observed on the same node set. Network series data are observed when a changing network is observed over time (e.g., a social media network at the end of each week) or when a statistical network is estimated from time series data (e.g., stock market correlation networks in different years). We approach this problem by embedding the network series in a semi-symmetric tensor and performing tensor PCA on this representation.\nSchematic Diagram of Semi-Symmetric Tensor PCAWe rigorously analyze Tensor PCA in the semi-symmetric context, proving consistency under an analogue of the “low-rank + noise” model for matrix PCA: somewhat remarkably, despite the difficulty of the tensor setting, our results are within a logarithmic factor of classical PCA results. Our proof technique depends on the classical Davis-Kahan theorem (and some painful algebra) and we hope to apply it further to a variety of tensor decomposition problems. Finally, we apply our method to a variety of synthetic and real data sets and find some counter-intuitive results about the Supreme Court of the United States.\nTensor PCA applied to SCOTUS Voting BehaviorsAn interesting quick of our analysis is that it allows for differing and possibly adversarial noise at each iteration of the\ntensor power method. While we don’t explore this fully, this has clear implications for both secure and online variants\nof our approach.\nPresentations: I presented this work at the 2022 Conference on New Advances in Statistics and Data Science (NASDS) and won the 2022 NASDS Best Poster Award.

Equally important, though less remarked upon, is the important structure present in large data sets. Statistical approaches that incorporate knowledge of this structure, whether spatio-temporal dependence or sparsity in a suitable basis, are essential to accurately capture the richness of modern large scale data sets. This thesis presents four novel methodologies for dealing with various types of highly structured data in a statistically rich and computationally efficient manner. The first project considers sparse regression and sparse covariance selection for complex valued data. While complex valued data is ubiquitous in spectral analysis and neuroimaging, typical machine learning techniques discard the rich structure of complex numbers, losing valuable phase information in the process. A major contribution of this project is the development of convex analysis for a class of non-smooth “Wirtinger” functions, which allows high-dimensional statistical theory to be applied in the complex domain. The second project considers clustering of large scale multi-way array (“tensor”) data. Efficient clustering algorithms for convex bi-clustering and co-clustering are derived and shown to achieve an order-of-magnitude speed improvement over previous approaches. The third project considers principal component analysis for data with smooth and/or sparse structure. An efficient manifold optimization technique is proposed which can flexibly adapt to a wide variety of regularization schemes, while efficiently estimating multiple principal components. Despite the non-convexity of the manifold constraints used, it is possible to establish convergence to a stationary point. Additionally, a new family of “deflation” schemes are proposed to allow iterative estimation of nested principal components while maintaining weaker forms of orthogonality. The fourth and final project develops a multivariate volatility model for US natural gas markets. This model flexibly incorporates differing market dynamics across time scales and different spatial locations. A rigorous evaluation shows significantly improved forecasting performance both in- and out-of-sample. All four methodologies are able to flexibly incorporate prior knowledge in a statistically rigorous fashion while maintaining a high degree of computational performance.\nCopy of Record: Rice University Library\nSummary: This thesis collects most of the work I published during my Ph.D. as well as some work on statistical learning in complex variables which has not yet been published elsewhere. The treatment of complex variables is slightly different than that typically appearing in the literature: by tweaking the usual construction of \\(\\mathbb{C}^n\\) as a real inner product space, I show that essentially all results from real-valued statistical learning theory translate without effort: results for complex-valued sparse regression or Gaussian graphical models are comparable to their real-valued, with a better sample complexity if we assume “proper” (isotropic) sub-Gaussian noise. These results can be combined with the concentration bounds of Fiecas et al (2019, EJS) to get best-in-class sparsistency results for probabilistic graphical models of stochastic processes. While the optimization theory developed in this thesis could be pushed further, e.g. to non-Gaussian / generalized linear models, the correct construction of complex-GLMs is a bit tricky1 and omitted here.\nPresentations: Thesis defense was held virtually and the Zoom recording can be viewed below:\n\n\nDirect YouTube Link.

      "contents": "\nAbstract: The relative abundance patterns of tropical trees have been of interest since the expeditions of Alfred Russel Wallace, but little is known about how differences in relative abundance relate to reproductive patterns. Flowering is resource-dependent and fitness differences as well as differences in the quality of the abiotic and biotic neighborhood may contribute to the variation in reproductive status responsible for population-level flowering patterns. This variation determines the density and distance between flowering conspecifics and may alter relative abundance extremes among species during reproduction, factors known to influence pollination success. We collected flowering status data for a guild of twenty-three co-occurring tree species that flower in the understory of the Korup Forest Dynamics Plot in Cameroon. We examined how the occurrence and location of reproductive events were related to spatial patterns of adult abundance, focal tree size, neighborhood crowding, and habitat, while accounting for the influence of shared ancestry. Across species, the probability of flowering was higher for individuals of rarer species and for larger individuals but was unrelated to neighborhood crowding or habitat differences. Relative abundance extremes were reduced when only flowering individuals were considered, leading to a negative relationship between plot abundance and flowering probability at the species level that was not structured by shared ancestry. Spatially, flowering conspecifics tended to be overdispersed relative to all adult conspecifics. Rare species are predicted to suffer Allee effects or reduced fitness due to the difficulty of finding mates at low densities and frequencies. Here, however, rare species appear to maximize the size of their mate pool, compared to abundant species. If this partial “leveling of the playing field” during reproduction is typical, it has consequences for our understanding of biodiversity maintenance and species coexistence in tropical forests.\nWorking Paper: BioRXiv 10.1101/2021.01.14.426416\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nAbstract: Clustering of time series data exhibits a number of challenges not present in other settings, notably the problem of registration (alignment) of observed signals. Typical approaches include pre-registration to a user-specified template or time warping approaches which attempt to optimally align series with a minimum of distortion. For many signals obtained from recording or sensing devices, these methods may be unsuitable as a template signal is not available for pre-registration, while the distortion of warping approaches may obscure meaningful temporal information. We propose a new method for automatic time series alignment within a clustering problem. Our approach, Temporal Registration using Optimal Unitary Transformations (TROUT), is based on a novel dissimilarity measure between time series that is easy to compute and automatically identifies optimal alignment between pairs of time series. By embedding our new measure in a optimization formulation, we retain well-known advantages of computational and statistical performance. We provide an efficient algorithm for TROUT-based clustering and demonstrate its superior performance over a range of competitors.\nPublisher DOI: 10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414417\nWorking Copy: ArXiv 2012.04756\nSummary: Clustering time series is a common problem in many applications, but it is much more difficult when analyzing non-aligned signals. Typically, signals are pre-registered to some template or common alignment, but this assumes that such a template exists, when discovering “standard signals” is often the goal of clustering in the first case. We instead propose to align signals to each other within the clustering problem. Given two signals, the optimal alignment between them can be found by an orthogonal rotation (phase-shift), with closed form: this motivates TROUT-clustering\n\\[\\text{argmin}_{\\mathbf{U} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times p}} \\frac{1}{2}d_{\\text{TROUT}}(\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{X})^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{\\substack{i, j = 1 \\\\ i < j}}^n w_{ij} \\|\\mathbf{U}_{i\\cdot} - \\mathbf{U}_{j\\cdot}\\|_q\\]\nwhere\n\\[d_{\\text{TROUT}}(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{x}) = \\min_{\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)} \\|\\mathbf{u} - e^{i \\theta} \\mathbf{x}\\|_2 \\implies  d_{\\text{TROUT}}(\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{X})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n d_{\\text{TROUT}}(\\mathbf{U}_{i\\cdot}, \\mathbf{X}_{i\\cdot})^2.\\]\nis \\(d_{\\text{TROUT}}\\) our “phase-adaptive” (optimally aligning) distance1 To solve this problem, we develop a Majorization-Minimization scheme, the sub-problems of which have closed form solution, yielding an efficient algorithm.\nNote that the clustering formulation is designed so that each observation (row of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)) is rotated to coincide with the shared centroids (row of \\(\\mathbf{U}\\)) rather than to each other: this avoids the registration problem entirely, but does give a solution that is only identified up to phase. Our method performs well under a variety of noise conditions and often even out-performs traditional clustering methods with oracle pre-registration.\nExamples of TROUT ClusteringComparison of TROUT, Time-Warping, and Traditional ClusteringCitation:\n@INPROCEEDINGS{Weylandt:2021-TROUT,\n  AUTHOR=\"Michael Weylandt and George Michailidis\",\n  TITLE=\"Automatic Registration and Convex Clustering of Time Series\",\n  DOI=\"10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414417\"\n  PAGES={5609-5613},\n  CROSSREF=\"ICASSP:2021\"\n}\n\n@PROCEEDINGS{ICASSP:2021,\n  BOOKTITLE=\"ICASSP 2021: Proceedings of the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing\",\n  YEAR=2021,\n  LOCATION=\"Toronto, Canada\"\n  EDITOR=\"Tim Davidson and Dong Yu\"\n}\n\n\\(d_{\\text{TROUT}}\\) does not define a true metric, so the TROUT-clustering problem is not guaranteed to be convex.↩︎\n",

      "contents": "\nMy research is generally in the area of statistical machine learning. I interpret statistical in two senses: i) using tools from statistical theory to understand and improve methods, even those not originally developed from a statistical point-of-view; and ii) focused on the generation of insights and knowledge rather than just “black-box” predictive or generative power.1 Under that broad umbrella, I am particularly interested in structured dimension reduction, network analysis, and ML fairness, as well as various computational questions arising from methods work. My current application areas of interest include detection and attribution in climate analytics and the development of graph-inspired information retrieval systems.\nModern scientific experiments produce vast quantities of data that are nearly-impossible to analyze with traditional EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) techniques. Moreover, these vast data sets typically have complex dependence structures that must be reflected in unsupervised analysis. I have developed techniques for flexibly incorporating structure into dimension reduction algorithms, most notably sparsity and smoothness and low-rank network structure. This line of work is particularly inspired by the analysis of large-scale climate simulations from global climate models. These models produce massive output, with significant temporal and spatial correlation. With collaborators from Sandia National Laboratories, I have applied regularized PCA to climate simulations in order to identify the principal effects of massive volcanic eruptions on the global climate.\nClimate scientists often refer to low-dimensional summarizations of climate data as “fingerprints”: these fingerprints may be motivated by domain expertise, e.g. global mean temperature, or by some statistical criterion, such as maximizing variance explained. Among their many uses in climate science, fingerprints are often used as inputs to Detection & Attribution studies; that is, they are used as evidence to detect changes in a climate quantity of interest and to attribute that change to a particular (posited) cause. In collaboration with a cross-disciplinary team from SNL, I am working to develop advanced fingerprinting techniques which maximize the statistical power of downstream Detection & Attribution studies. This work incorporates ideas from supervised dimension reduction, such as Partial Least Squares or Canonical Correlation Analysis (PLS/CCA), to find “most-attributable” fingerprints, i.e., those aspects of the climate that appear to exhibit the most robust evidence of change. This analysis poses serious inferential challenges-i.e., if we have found the ‘most different’ aspect of the climate, classical attribution studies are no longer statistically valid-but we believe that we will be able to address these as climate models also provide us with the ability to generate “null samples” from which we can estimate a suitable sampling distribution.\nI also maintain an ongoing collaboration with Sandia National Labs (SNL) in the area of large graph analytics. Our recent work focuses on the intersection of computational algorithms and statistical theory for exceptionally large graph problems, with a particular focus on the “seed set expansion” (or local community detection) problem. My SNL collaborators bring expertise in a range of applied math and engineering fields, including high-performance computing, numerical linear algebra, tensor analysis, and graph algorithms. This collaboration is particularly rewarding as we are able to work with SNL’s mission-focused analytics teams to identify insights and challenges that a purely-academic investigation may overlook.\nIf you would like to discuss any of these topics further, please dont hesitate to get in touch.\nMy work has been supported by grants and fellowships from the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the US Intelligence Community (US IC), and the Sandia National Laboratories Laboratory Directed Research and Development program (SNL LDRD). For more, see here.\n\nThis latter goal overlaps with “explainable” or “interpretable” AI (XAI); to the degree there is a difference, XAI focuses more on explaining the results of existing prediction algorithms - which may be of standalone value as black-box predictors - while my work centers the knowledge generation aims. In general, the methods I focus on consider predictive power as evidence of a meaningful scientific relationship, not as the end goal.↩︎\n",

If you are interested in collaborating on further development of this package, please get in touch.\nDirect Link: http://github.com/DataSlingers/MoMA\nPackage Documentation: https://DataSlingers.github.io/MoMA/\nRelated Publications: Sparse and Functional PCA, Multi-Rank SFPCA, Coarse Noisy Graph Alignment\n\n\n\n",
